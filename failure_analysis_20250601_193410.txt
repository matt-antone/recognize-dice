DICE DETECTION FAILURE PATTERN ANALYSIS
==================================================

Dataset: 250 images
Failures: 136 (54.4%)
Successes: 114 (45.6%)

CRITICAL INSIGHTS:
- Value 6 Under-Detection: Only 1 of 245 detections (0.4%)
  Action: Investigate pip pattern recognition for value 6 specifically

- High Overall Failure Rate: 54.4% of images failed detection
  Action: Implement angle-agnostic detection improvements

- Value 1 Over-Detection: Value 1 represents 41.6% of detections (expected ~16.7%)
  Action: Review pip counting algorithm - may be detecting single dots incorrectly
