### Root Cause Analysis

**Training Data Issues:**

- **Imbalanced dataset**: Too many "1" examples in training
- **Insufficient examples**: Not enough 2,3,4,5,6 variations
- **Model confusion**: 2 vs 3 discrimination poor (similar dot patterns)

**Possible Solutions:**

1. **Retrain with balanced dataset** - Ensure equal examples of each dice value
2. **Data augmentation** - Add more 2,3,4,5,6 examples with variations
3. **Different model architecture** - Try classification vs object detection
4. **Manual dataset curation** - Verify training data quality
