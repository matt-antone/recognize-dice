## Detection Algorithm Insights - CRITICAL

### Debug Analysis Results

- **HoughCircles Issues**:

  - Conservative params: 0-1 detections (under-detection)
  - Very sensitive params: 35-44 detections (massive over-detection/noise)
  - Edge detection only 0.5-0.7% pixels (too low for reliable circle detection)

- **Promising Methods**:

  - **Contour Detection**: Exactly 1 dice-shaped contour per frame âœ…
  - **Blob Detection**: Consistent 1-2 blobs per frame âœ…
  - **Combined Approach**: Much more reliable than single method

- **Image Processing Insights**:
  - CLAHE reducing contrast (-4.5 to -5.4) - removed from pipeline
  - Images somewhat dark (mean ~70-75) but good natural contrast
  - Over-smoothing was degrading edge detection

### Improved Algorithm Features

- **Dual detection**: Contour + blob detection with deduplication
- **Lightweight preprocessing**: Bilateral filter only, no CLAHE
- **Smart dice value estimation**: Dot counting with brightness fallbacks
- **Reasonable confidence scoring**: 0.6-0.7 for computer vision methods
- **Area and aspect ratio filtering**: Prevents false positives

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Test Improved Detection**: Run `python3 test_improved_detection.py` on Pi
2. **Validate Results**: Compare with debug analysis baseline
3. **Integrate with Main App**: Update main.py to use improved detection
4. **Model Integration**: Convert reference model to TensorFlow Lite (can do on macOS)
5. **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune based on real results

## Active Decisions - CONFIRMED
