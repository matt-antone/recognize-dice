# Product Context: D6 Dice Recognition App

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement

Traditional dice games require manual counting and human verification of dice rolls, which can be:

- Error-prone in fast-paced games
- Difficult for visually impaired users
- Challenging in low-light conditions
- Time-consuming when multiple dice are involved

### Solution

An AI-powered dice recognition system that automatically detects and identifies dice values in real-time, providing instant, accurate feedback.

## Target Users

1. **Board Game Enthusiasts**: Quick, accurate dice roll verification
2. **Accessibility Users**: Visual assistance for dice reading
3. **Educational**: Teaching probability and statistics with real dice
4. **Developers**: Reference implementation for computer vision on Pi

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow

1. User places dice in camera view
2. System immediately detects and highlights dice
3. System displays the face value clearly
4. Updates happen in real-time as dice move or change

### Key Features

- **Instant Recognition**: Near real-time detection with minimal delay
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear display of detected values
- **Robust Detection**: Works under various lighting and angles
- **Simple Interface**: Minimal learning curve

### Technical Behavior

- Continuous camera monitoring
- Automatic dice detection and classification
- Confidence scoring for reliability
- Graceful handling of edge cases (no dice, multiple dice, etc.)

## Success Metrics

- **Speed**: <200ms detection latency
- **Accuracy**: >90% correct classification
- **Usability**: Works for users of all technical levels
- **Reliability**: Consistent performance across sessions

## User Journey

1. **Setup**: Connect Pi camera, run application
2. **Use**: Place dice in view, see instant results
3. **Interact**: Roll dice, watch values update
4. **Trust**: Rely on accurate, consistent detection
